## Overview
For my thesis work, I wanted to study how different evolutionary pressures affect song learning in birds. I coded an agent-based simulation model in R, and refactored it into C#, so that it would run faster. To allow other researchers that might want to use the model to see how it works without downloading the C# library or R package, I used the web assembly tool Blazor to convert the C# library into this web app.

## Tools and Languages
C#, Blazor, Web Assembly, R
